## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/ngs_analysis.git
cd ngs_analysis
bash setup.sh
source ngs/bin/activate

# Full pipeline — Round 2 BAMs vs pre-computed Round 1 consensus
python run_pipeline.py \
  --bam-dir /data/R2/ \
  --r1-consensus /data/R1/R1_cluster_consensus.csv \
  --min-q 12 \

## Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.10
- [HMMER](http://hmmer.org/) — enables full ANARCI IMGT CDR numbering
  ```bash
  sudo apt install hmmer        # Ubuntu/Debian
  brew install hmmer            # macOS
  conda install -c bioconda hmmer
  ```
- BAM files must be aligned to the IMGT Vicugna IGHV germline FASTA **before** running `bam_extract.py`:
  ```bash
  minimap2 -ax map-ont imgt_vicugna_ighv.fa sample.bam > sample_aligned.bam
  samtools sort -o sample_aligned_sorted.bam sample_aligned.bam
  samtools index sample_aligned_sorted.bam
  ```

All Python dependencies installed by `setup.sh`.

## Scripts

### `bam_extract.py` — Step 1

Extracts VHH sequences from BAM files aligned to IMGT Vicugna germlines.
Designed for millions of reads across 10+ BAM files.

**Extraction approach:**
Uses the Dorado/minimap2 alignment coordinates directly — CIGAR arithmetic locates the VHH coding region on the reference without any per-read regex search. Insertions within the amplicon window are included in the extracted sequence; deletions are absent, preserving correct length for all three translation frames. Reads whose alignment does not fully cover the reference window `[--ref-vhh-start, --ref-vhh-end)` (e.g. partial alignments at library ends) fall back to fuzzy FR1/J4 motif search.

**Deduplication before annotation:**
Unique DNA amplicons are counted across all reads in pass 1. Translation and ANARCI CDR annotation run only once per unique sequence — not once per read — dramatically reducing work on high-depth libraries. ANARCI is called in batches (`--anarci-batch`) to amortise hmmer subprocess overhead.

**Parallelism:**
Multiple BAM files are processed in parallel worker processes (`--workers`). Default is one worker per BAM up to the available CPU count.

**Output:** One row per unique protein sequence with a `Count` column (total ONT reads). This Count propagates through all downstream steps and drives consensus weighting.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--min-q` | 10.0 | Minimum mean ONT Q-score |
| `--min-len` | 300 | Minimum read length (bp) |
| `--max-len` | 1000 | Maximum read length (bp) |
| `--cdr-method` | anarci | CDR extraction: `anarci` or `offset` |
| `--use-umi` | off | Enable UMI deduplication (Dorado `UX` tag) |
| `--ref-vhh-start` | 0 | Reference start of VHH amplicon window |
| `--ref-vhh-end` | 390 | Reference end of VHH amplicon window |
| `--fr1` | CAGGTGCAGCTG | FR1 motif for fallback search |
| `--j4` | ACCCAGGTCACC | J4 motif for fallback search |
| `--fr-mm` | 2 | Fuzzy mismatch tolerance for motif fallback |
| `--workers` | #BAMs | Parallel BAM worker processes |
| `--anarci-batch` | 5000 | Proteins per ANARCI batch call |

```bash
python bam_extract.py /path/to/bams/ --min-q 12 --workers 10
```

The summary table printed at the end shows **CIGAR path** vs **Motif fallback** counts per file. A high motif-fallback rate (>10%) suggests the `--ref-vhh-end` value may need adjusting for your reference.

### `cluster_levenshtein.py` — Step 2

Graph-based clonotyping using normalised Levenshtein (edit) distance.

**Approach:** Sequences are nodes; edges connect pairs with similarity ≥ threshold. Connected components define clonotypes. The graph operates on **unique CDR3 sequences**; all aggregation (counts, consensus, entropy) is **weighted by the `Count` column** from Step 1, ensuring that a sequence observed 5,000 times contributes proportionally more than one observed once. Uses [rapidfuzz](https://github.com/maxbachmann/RapidFuzz) SIMD acceleration; switches to length-binned BK-tree for > 5,000 unique sequences.

**Why Levenshtein over BLOSUM for VHH?** VHH CDR3s vary substantially in length between clones (germline D-segment usage, exonuclease trimming, somatic hypermutation indels). Levenshtein normalises by length naturally; BLOSUM gap penalties are arbitrary and length-blind.

**Outputs:**
- `*_clonotypes.csv` — every input sequence with its cluster assignment and `Cluster_Count` (total reads in that clonotype)
- `*_cluster_consensus.csv` — one row per clonotype; `Cluster_Count` = total reads (sum of member Counts); consensus sequences and biophysical metrics are Count-weighted

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--input` | — | Input CSV from Step 1 (`*_vhh_protein_cdr.csv`) |
| `--output` | input stem | Output file prefix/stem |
| `--threshold` | 0.80 | Similarity threshold 0–1 (higher = stricter) |
| `--column` | CDR3 | Sequence column to cluster |
| `--min-count` | 5 | Min total reads to report a clonotype |
| `--use-vgene` | off | Stratify by `V_gene` column if present |

```bash
python cluster_levenshtein.py \
  --input sample_vhh_protein_cdr.csv \
  --output results/sample \
  --threshold 0.85
```

**Threshold guide:**

| Threshold | Edits per 14 aa CDR3 | Use case |
|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| 0.95 | ~1 | Exact-clone tracking across runs |
| 0.85 | ~2 | Standard enrichment analysis (recommended) |
| 0.80 | ~3 | Captures affinity-matured variants |
| 0.70 | ~4 | Groups distant CDR3 families |

**Consensus output columns:**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Cluster` | Clonotype ID (1 = most abundant) |
| `CDR3` | Count-weighted majority-vote consensus CDR3 |
| `CDR1`, `CDR2` | From the highest-Count member sequence |
| `CDR_Concatenated` | CDR1+CDR2+CDR3 from highest-Count member |
| `Representative_CDR3` | Highest-Count CDR3 in cluster |
| `Cluster_Count` | **Total reads** across all cluster members (sum of Count) |
| `Unique_Sequences` | Number of distinct CDR3 strings in cluster |
| `Mean_CDR3_Length` | Count-weighted mean CDR3 length |
| `CDR1/2/3_Length` | Lengths of consensus CDR sequences |
| `Shannon_Entropy` | Count-weighted diversity within clonotype |
| `pI` | Isoelectric point of CDR_Concatenated |
| `GRAVY` | Hydrophobicity (grand average of hydropathicity) |
| `Charge_pH7` | Net charge at pH 7.0 |
| `Aromaticity` | Aromatic residue fraction |
| `MW_kDa` | Molecular weight (kDa) |
| `Liabilities` | Union of PTM/liability flags across all members |

---

### `cluster_enrichment.py` — Step 3

Compares Round 1 vs Round 2 cluster consensus files. Computes log2(CPM) enrichment, two-tailed binomial test p-values, and Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction. Outputs an annotated Excel file, a matching CSV, and volcano and rank-enrichment plots.

**Statistical approach:** Uses a two-tailed binomial test, which is the correct model for sequencing proportion data where only total reads per round are experimentally fixed (not total reads per cluster). Laplace smoothing `(c1+0.5)/(total_r1+0.5)` gives a well-behaved expected proportion for clusters absent in R1. CPM pseudocount (0.5) is used only for fold-change estimation and is independent of the significance test.

Accepts `.csv` or `.xlsx` consensus input. Matches clusters by exact CDR3 identity first, falling back to normalised Levenshtein similarity (rapidfuzz, SIMD-accelerated). 1:1 matching is enforced — if multiple R2 clusters fuzzy-match the same R1 cluster, the first (highest-ranked) match wins and the rest are treated as novel, preventing shared-count inflation.

```bash
python cluster_enrichment.py \
  R1_cluster_consensus.csv \
  R2_cluster_consensus.csv \
  --output results/ \
  --min-r2-count 10 \
  --log2-cutoff 1.0 \
  --fdr-cutoff 0.05
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `file_r1` | — | Round 1 consensus file (.csv or .xlsx) |
| `file_r2` | — | Round 2 consensus file (.csv or .xlsx) |
| `--output` | `.` | Output directory for enrichment CSV and plots |
| `--threshold` | 0.85 | Normalised Levenshtein similarity for fuzzy CDR3 matching |
| `--no-fuzzy` | off | Exact CDR3 matching only |
| `--log2-cutoff` | 1.0 | log2 enrichment cutoff for volcano |
| `--fdr-cutoff` | 0.05 | FDR significance threshold |
| `--min-r2-count` | 0 | Exclude R2 clusters with fewer than N reads (reduces multiple-testing burden) |
| `--entropy-flag` | 1.5 | Shannon entropy above which a cluster is flagged as `heterogeneous` in `Quality_Flag` column |

**Quality_Flag column** (present when `Shannon_Entropy` is in the R2 input):

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `heterogeneous` | Shannon entropy > `--entropy-flag`; cluster contains many divergent CDR3s |
| `low_depth` | R2 cluster has < 20 total reads; fold change is unreliable |
| _(empty)_ | No quality concern |

### `run_pipeline.py` — Orchestrator

Chains Steps 1–3 from a single command.

```bash
# Full pipeline
python run_pipeline.py \
  --bam-dir /data/R2/ \
  --r1-consensus /data/R1/R1_cluster_consensus.csv \
  --min-q 12 \
  --threshold 0.85

# Enrichment only (consensus CSVs already computed)
python run_pipeline.py \
  --enrich-only \
  --r1-consensus R1_cluster_consensus.csv \
  --r2-consensus R2_cluster_consensus.csv
```

## Upstream notes

- Align BAM files to the IMGT Vicugna IGHV germline FASTA before Step 1 (`minimap2 -ax map-ont`)
- Use HAC or SUP Dorado basecalling model (`dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_hac@v4.3` minimum)
- Use `--no-trim` in Dorado if VHH primers are part of the amplicon
- Add dual UMIs in library prep for accurate PCR deduplication — enable with `--use-umi`
- Aim for ≥ 10,000 reads per barcode post-filtering
